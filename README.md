# Detect-Credit-Card-Fraud-using-R

## How to Detect Credit Card Fraud:
- Use an Address Verification System (AVS) to verify a cardholder's identity
- Verify the IP address of a customer
- Be wary of anonymous email addresses
- Ship only to the cardholder's billing address
- Analyze transaction data

#### The aim of this R project is to build a classifier that can detect credit card fraudulent transactions. We will use a variety of machine learning algorithms that will be able to discern fraudulent from non-fraudulent ones. By the end of this machine learning project, you will learn how to implement machine learning algorithms to perform classification.
